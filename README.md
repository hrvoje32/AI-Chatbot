This project involves the design and development of a specialised AI chatbot focused on helping university students manage stress. Given the increasing mental health concerns in academic environments, this chatbot aims to provide a creative, accessible, and practical solution to recognize, understand, and assist students in dealing with stress.

Key Features and Functionalities:

Student-Centric Stress Management:
o	Tailored to understand the unique challenges faced by university students, including academic pressure, interpersonal relationships, and career concerns.

Feedback Mechanism:
o	Incorporates a feedback feature, allowing continuous improvement and personalisation based on user interactions.

Privacy and Confidentiality:
o	Offers options for users to withhold feedback or data sharing, ensuring user confidentiality and trust.

Mobile Optimization:
o	Focused on mobile accessibility, enabling students to access the chatbot's services anytime and anywhere, catering to the mobile-dependent lifestyle of modern students.

Innovative Response Mechanism:
o	Features a novel system that allows users to decide if chatbot should save the given question in case it doesn’t know answer, enhancing its learning and effectiveness over time.

Spelling and Grammar Handling:
o	Includes basic handling for spelling and grammar errors.

Conversation History Selection:
o	Allows users to choose whether to keep a history of their conversations, providing additional control over their data.


Technical Implementation:

React Native: 
o	Utilises React Native (still just React until design is finished) for developing a native mobile application, ensuring smooth performance on mobile devices.

Python, RASA, and Flask: 
o	Employs Python for backend development, RASA for AI functionalities, and Flask as a micro web framework to handle requests and responses.


This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
